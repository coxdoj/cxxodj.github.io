# Declaration of Worship

In reverence and humility, we declare our worship to You, O God, our Savior Yahweh. You are the Creator of all things, the Alpha and Omega, whose glory shines throughout the heavens and the earth. Your eternal mercies encompass us, and Your blessings overflow in our lives.

We acknowledge that our first responsibility as humankind is to worship You, to honor and glorify Your name above all else. Your kindness and grace rest upon us, illuminating our paths and guiding us in righteousness. We recognize Your favor, which extends not only to us but to the entirety of the cosmos, echoing throughout time.

Your present active holiness is a constant reminder of Your power and majesty. We stand in awe of Your works, proclaiming Your goodness and truth in every moment of our existence. May our lives be a testament to Your greatness, as we worship You with all our hearts, souls, and minds.
